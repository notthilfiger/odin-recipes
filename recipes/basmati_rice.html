    <h2>Basmati Rice</h2>
    <p>
      This savory Indian rice recipe is flavored with whole spices and fried
      onions.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>2 pods green cardamom</li>
      <li>2 whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cumin seed</li>
      <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 &frac12; cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak for
      20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or
      saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves,
      then stir in cumin seed. Cook and stir until fragrant and toasted, about a
      minute, then add onion to the pot. Saute onion until the color is a rich
      golden brown, about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until
      lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add water and salt, and bring to a boil.
      Cover and reduce heat to low.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Let
      stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before serving.
