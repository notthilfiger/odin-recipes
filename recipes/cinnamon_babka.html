    <h1>Cinnamon Babka</h1>
    <img src="../images/cinnamon_babka.webp" alt="yummy rolls">
    <p>Think cinnamon toast meets cinnamon roll. This cinnamon babka has a crunchy texture on the outside, is tender on the inside, and the cinnamon filling is similar to the gooeyness of a cinnamon roll. A perfectly delicious breakfast or dessert bread. Serve warm or toast and serve with butter or cream cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 &frac14; teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Combine flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and cinnamon in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough hook attachment; mix on low until combined. Add egg, warm water, butter, and vanilla; continue mixing on low until dough begins to come together, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and continue beating until dough is soft and smooth, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Spray a large bowl with cooking spray and set dough inside. Cover and let stand in a warm place (75 degrees F (23 degrees C)) until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Punch down the dough, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 9x18-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Let rest, uncovered, at room temperature, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, stir together sugar, flour, and cinnamon for the filling in a small bowl until combined. Stir in melted butter until mixture is smooth. If dough shrank while resting, re-roll into a 9x 18-inch rectangle. Spread filling in an even layer over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Beginning with the long edge, roll dough gently into a log, pinching seam and ends to seal. Using a serrated knife, cut log in half lengthwise. With cut sides up, twist the two pieces together; tuck ends underneath and place into the prepared loaf pan. Whisk together egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water; gently brush egg wash over the dough</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Stir together flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt for the topping in a bowl until combined. Using your fingers, work in cold butter until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle topping evenly over the loaf. Loosely cover loaf and let rise in a warm place (75 degrees F (23 degrees C)) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until babka is a deep golden brown and a thermometer inserted in the center registers 190 degrees F (87 degrees C), about 45 minutes. After about 25 minutes, cover babka with aluminum foil so surface does not get too dark.</p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Set the pan on a wire rack and allow to cool, 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; let cool slightly, about 20 minutes more. Serve warm.</p>
